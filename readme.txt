Hi

Just copy the folder named 'movie trailer for submission' into a local directory. 
Select the python file, instance.py and hit enter.
You should see a tab opening in your local browser with my top 6 movie posters being displayed. 
Click on any one of them to start playing the youtube trailer video for those movies. 

This is my first code ever - hope it works !

Enjoy.
